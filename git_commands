# Safely Deleting a Git Branch

This guide walks through the steps to safely delete a Git branch, ensuring that no unmerged changes are lost and that the deletion process is smooth.

## 1. Ensure you are not on the branch to be deleted

Before deleting a branch, switch to another branch (e.g., `main` or `master`):

```bash
git checkout main
```

Attempting to delete the branch you are currently on will result in an error.

## 2. Check if the branch has been merged (for local branches)

To safely delete a branch, it's good practice to check if the branch has been merged. You can do this by running:

```bash
git branch --merged
```

This command lists branches that have been merged into the current branch. If your branch appears in the list, it has been merged. If it doesnâ€™t appear, there may still be unmerged changes.

You can also check a specific branch for merge status:

```bash
git branch --merged <branch>
```

## 3. Delete a Local Branch

Once you're sure the branch has been merged (or you're sure you no longer need it), delete the branch using:

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

If the branch has not been merged and you want to delete it regardless (force delete), use:

```bash
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

## 4. Delete a Remote Branch

To delete a branch from a remote repository (e.g., GitHub):

```bash
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

Alternatively, for older Git versions:

```bash
git push origin :<branch-name>
```

## 5. Confirm the Deletion

After deleting the branch, list your branches to confirm:

- To list local branches:
  ```bash
  git branch
  ```

- To list remote branches:
  ```bash
  git branch -r
  ```

### Example:

Let's say you want to delete a branch named `feature-branch`:

1. **Switch to another branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Check if `feature-branch` has been merged**:
   ```bash
   git branch --merged
   ```

3. **Delete the local branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature-branch
   ```

4. **Delete the remote branch** (if necessary):
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete feature-branch
   ```
